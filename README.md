# springboot-with-thymeleaf-Funix-assignment1
 
## Introduction

this is the first assignment of Funix that I redo with using Spring Boot and Thymeleaf (instead of Jsp) including:
- printOdd page to print all odd number from 1 to 500
- a page to print fibonacci numbers that is < 10946
- A jsp Couse register page and another page to show the result

## Version
-	Java 12
-	Spring Tool Suite 4 (Version: 4.3.2.RELEASE)
-	Maven (version 3.6.1)
-	Tomcat (version 9.0.22) but not included. As a result please download yourself 
-	Bootstrap (version 4.3.1)
- Other components are used according to “pom.xml” in the project

## How to install
please import as a maven project

## Project Detail:
-	This is the project that used Spring Boot and Thymeleaf . This is due to when I used Spring Boot and then I wondered then what?? Except for some copy and paste, there is nothing else to do. As a result, I decided to use Thymeleaf (I may need to make non – web app view maybe)
-	Although I used Thymeleaf , I still follow Funix requirement to use Bootstrap with Thymeleaf. Moreover I also included parts (or it is called fragment in Thymeleaf) from template “main.html” inside “fragments” folder

##	Possible Issue 
-	Minimal testing, as a result very few exceptions are found and handled as Funix requirement is not strict

## Known Issue
-	Bad front-end design: I hate graphic design so please
